The concept of logical volume management is very much similar to the concept of virtualization, i.e.
you can create as many virtual storage volumes on top of a single storage device as you want. 
The logical storage volumes thus created can be expanded or shrunk according to your growing or reducing storage needs.

In this case, each of these physical devices has its own partitions and the respective file systems.
The management of all of these partitions can become a mess if handled as it is. This is where the concept of logical volume management comes into play.
It allows you to aggregate all the partitions of different physical devices into a single logical volume group from where they can be managed centrally. 

From this volume group, you can extract multiple logical volumes depending upon your requirements.
Moreover, the exact space allocated to each logical volume can also be increased or decreased depending upon your needs.
