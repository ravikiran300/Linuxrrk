Its 4. It is a limitation of MBR.

If you want more partitions, you can create three primary and one extended partition.

Inside extended partition, you can create as many logical partitions.

Hope it helps.

enables the combining of multiple individual hard drives and/or disk partitions into a single volume group (VG)
That volume group can then be subdivided into logical volumes (LV) or used as a single large volum

The concept of logical volume management is very much similar to the concept of virtualization, i.e.
you can create as many virtual storage volumes on top of a single storage device as you want. 
The logical storage volumes thus created can be expanded or shrunk according to your growing or reducing storage needs.

In this case, each of these physical devices has its own partitions and the respective file systems.
The management of all of these partitions can become a mess if handled as it is. This is where the concept of logical volume management comes into play.
It allows you to aggregate all the partitions of different physical devices into a single logical volume group from where they can be managed centrally. 

From this volume group, you can extract multiple logical volumes depending upon your requirements.
Moreover, the exact space allocated to each logical volume can also be increased or decreased depending upon your needs.

creating physical volume
lsblk
pvcreate /dev/sdb
pvs

create volume group
pvs(look into physcial volume created
vgcreate new_vg /dev/sdb
vgs


create logical volume
lsblk
pvs
vgs
lvcreate -n test_lv -L 500M new_vg
mkfs.ext4 /dev/new_vg/test_lv (make file system on this logical volume)
(its  not mounted yet)

mounting
==
mkdir /test
mount /dev/new_vg/test_lv /test
df -h

add in /etc/fstab

===========

extending logical volume

lvextend -L 700M /dev/new_vg/test_lv

any issues
resizefs /dev/new_vg/test_lv
efsck /dev/new_vg/test_lv


======================

Reduce logical volume
umount /test
run e2fk on volume device
e2fsck -f /dev/new_vg/test_lv
lvreduce -L 400M /dev/new_vg/test_lv
resizefs /dev/new_vg/test_lv
mount /dev/new_vg/test_lv /test

pvdisplay
vgdisplay

the physical extentend of LVM is 4MB

In order to create a LVM snapshot of a logical volume, you have to execute the “lvcreate” command with the “-s” option for “snapshot”,
the “-L” option with the size and the name of the logical volume.
