ping hostname/ip

netstat hostname
netstat -rnv  (check your gateway which let u go out and route table 0.0.0.0 

If IP is NOT pingable
• Ping another server by name and then by IP
• Checking if your server has an IP address
• Ping your gateway/modem IP
• Check physical cable connection
• Check your routing table.

and check 

 /etc/resolv.conf: Lists nameservers that are used by your host for DNS resolution. 
If you are using DHCP, this file is automatically populated with DNS record issued by DHCP server.
 /etc/hosts/: It is just a static lookup method for resolution.
 /etc/nsswitch.conf: It defined order of resolution. Who should it consult first for resolution, a DNS or a host file?
 For example, if the file has following configuration hosts: files dns then /etc/hosts file will be checked first for resolution,
 if domain is still un-resolvable, DNS will then be consulted.
 
 

/etc/hosts: Mapping between IP addresses & hostnames, for name resolution.

127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost
10.2.3.4 myhost.domain.org myhost

/etc/nsswitch.conf: Sources that must be used by various system library lookup functions.

passwd: files nisplus nis
shadow: files nisplus nis
group: files nisplus nis
hosts: files dns nisplus nis

/etc/resolv.conf: Domain names that must be appended to bare hostnames, and DNS servers that will be used for name resolution.

Cannot Connect to a Website or an Application
=============================================

telnet 192.168.1.5 80 (http)
 
 Where:
telnet = command
192.168.1.5 = IP address of target server
80 = Port # of the service(httpd)

if still not reachable restart httpd service (systemctl service httpd)

if telnet is running properly something wrong with client machine



==============================================================================

Cannot SSH as Root/User
========================

If connected = Service is running If NOT connected = Service is not running

Login to the server and start the service

If pingable = Connect to service
telnet 192.168.1.5 22

Root is NOT permitted
Check for PermitRootLogin in
/etc/ssh/sshd_conf
User does NOT exist or has
nologin shell


systemctl status firewalld

check /var/log/secure.log

id username
/etc/password (/sbin/nologin)
