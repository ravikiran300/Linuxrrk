server not reachable
=====================
ping hostname/ip

netstat hostname (address)

If IP is NOT pingable
• Ping another server by name and then by IP
• Checking if your server has an IP address
• Ping your gateway/modem IP
• Check physical cable connection
• Check your routing table.

resolv.conf specifies the nameservers for resolver lookups, where it will actually use the DNS protocol for resolving the hostnames.

Typically the hosts file is used for administrative purposes, such as backend and internal functions, which is substantially more isolated in scope, as only the local server will reference it.

/etc/nsswitch.conf specifies the lookup order with the hosts entry.
