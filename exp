Linux kickstart

For Kickstart, an administrator needs to set it up as a web server, at least one Kickstart configuration file, and an installation media. 
An active DHCP server is also required so that after obtaining a valid DHCP address, new clients can find their Kickstart server and get Kickstarted.
Moreover, Kickstart utilizes different installation channels such as local media and NFS, etc.

Kickstart is responsible for installing an entire operating system from a specified list known as the Kickstart file.
Your choices for installation are automatically stored in a Kickstart file named “/root/anaconda-ks.cfg”

After an installation has been completed using Kickstart, check out the Kickstart file, and you will notice that it has all entries
you made during the installation. Keyboard and timezone locale settings, disc partitioning information, networking information, package options, Installation type, and so forth are all examples of these entries.

The most common way to using a Kickstart file is to place it in some exported NFS directory. After that, make it available over a web server, but other possibilities exist as well.
