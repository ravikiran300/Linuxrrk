RAID = Redundant Array of Independent Disk

Disks grouped in level 1 RAID is also called a mirrored array.

/proc/mdstat file contains the summary status of the RAID arrays so you can use cat /proc/mdstat command to view a summary status of your RAID arrays


mdadm is a tool for creating, managing, and monitoring RAID devices using the md driver.

Install mdadm on this system

sudo dnf install mdadm -y

======

Create a level 1 RAID array, at /dev/md0, with two devices: /dev/vdc and /dev/vdd
sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/vdc /dev/vdd
sudo mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/vde


Add another device, /dev/vde, to the previously created array, /dev/md0.
sudo mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --add /dev/vde


In your home directory you will find a file named specialfile. Add an ACL permission to this file so that the user called john can read and write to it.
sudo setfacl --modify user:john:rw specialfile



From the file called specialfile remove the ACL permissions for the user called john.
sudo setfacl --remove user:john specialfile



To the file called specialfile add an ACL permission for the group called mail. The mail group should get permissions to read and execute this file.
sudo setfacl --modify group:mail:rx specialfile

In your home directory you will find a directory called collection.
Use the setfacl command recursively, so that ACL entries are modified on the directory itself but also all the files and subdirectories it may contain. 
The ACL permissions should allow the user called john to read, write and execute all entries within this directory.
setfacl --recursive --modify user:john:rwx collection/


Remove the file called specialfile from your home directory. You will notice that not even sudo rm can remove this file. 
That's because the file is currently immutable. 
Remove the immutable flag from it and then delete the file

Execute below given command:
sudo chattr -i specialfile

Remove the file:
rm specialfil

Edit disk quotas for the user called john. Set a soft limit of 100 megabytes and hard limit of 500 megabytes on /mnt partition
sudo xfs_quota -x -c 'limit bsoft=100m bhard=500m john' /mnt/
