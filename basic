Bootloader
The Linux Kernel
Daemons
The Shell

=========================

Both UEFI and BIOS are low-level software that starts when you boot your PC before booting your operating system, 
but UEFI is a more modern solution, supporting larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features, and—conveniently—graphics and mouse cursors.

The BIOS goes through a POST, or Power-On Self Test, before booting your operating system. It checks to ensure your hardware configuration is valid and working properly.
If something is wrong, you’ll see an error message or hear a cryptic series of beep codes. 
You’ll have to look up what different sequences of beeps mean in the computer’s manual.

===

When your computer boots—and after the POST finishes—the BIOS looks for a Master Boot Record, or MBR,
stored on the boot device and uses it to launch the bootloader.

ls -l o??d 
If we want to list all files that begin with O, end with d and have two characters in between, we can use the following syntax:

=
ls -l o*d
To list all files that begin with O and end with d, no matter the number of character in between, we can use the following syntax

=
To list all files that begin with O and end with d and have a or c in between, we need to use the following syntax:ls -l a[ac]d

=====================================

pluralsight ALL=(ALL) ALL

Let's explain the syntax of this line:

    First off, we indicate which user this rule refers to (pluralsight).

    The first ALL means the rule applies to all hosts using the same /etc/sudoers file. Nowadays, this means the current host since the same file is not shared across other machines.
    Next, (ALL) ALL tells us that pluralsight will be allowed to run all commands as any user. Functionally speaking, this is equivalent to (root) ALL.

.bash_profile is read and executed when Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, while .bashrc is executed for an interactive non-login shell.

Use .bash_profile to run commands that should run only once, such as customizing the $PATH environment variable .

cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
-d is delimiter what comes after remove everthing
-f1 is field limiter
