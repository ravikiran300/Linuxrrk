Bootloader
The Linux Kernel
Daemons
The Shell

=========================

Both UEFI and BIOS are low-level software that starts when you boot your PC before booting your operating system, 
but UEFI is a more modern solution, supporting larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features, and—conveniently—graphics and mouse cursors.

The BIOS goes through a POST, or Power-On Self Test, before booting your operating system. It checks to ensure your hardware configuration is valid and working properly.
If something is wrong, you’ll see an error message or hear a cryptic series of beep codes. 
You’ll have to look up what different sequences of beeps mean in the computer’s manual.

When your computer boots—and after the POST finishes—the BIOS looks for a Master Boot Record, or MBR,
stored on the boot device and uses it to launch the bootloader.
